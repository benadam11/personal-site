Prosport Management is a sports agency that represents well known golfers including Bubba Watson (who recently won the Masters), Aaron Badley, and Geoff Ogilvy. Our goal was to create a sophisticated look for their company that was flexible enough for them to expand their business to other sports.

I developed a custom Sans Serif logotype based off of Edmondsans. I used a gray scale for their primary colors, and a green secondary pallet to be used on their website. I also developed brand guidelines, business cards, and letterhead for Prosport in time for the Masters.
