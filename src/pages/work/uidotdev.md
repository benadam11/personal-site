## Course Platform

### Dashboard

Building the course dashboard for [ui.dev](https://ui.dev) was a fun project. I was responsible for the design and implementation of the dashboard. The primary goal was to provide an interactive place for students to track their course progress and encourage them to continue learning using the badges and achievements they earn along the way. From a business perspective, the dashboard also supports a logged out experience which allows perspective students to preview the course and see a selection of the lessons to get a feel for the content. You can see that in action [here](https://ui.dev/c/react).

### Code Challenges

### Code Previews

### React Interview Questions

One of the sections we built for the course was a custom module for React Interview Questions. We explored a number of different ideas but settled for a quiz based module, that covered all of the common React specific questions we've seen covered in interviews. I build an interactive Card UI using `framer-motion` that allows students to flip the card to reveal the answer as well as the ability to filter based on the difficulty. The module also allows users to mark questions as completed once they feel comfortable with their ability to answer it correctly.

### Sharing Experience

One of our goals for Bytes was to improve organic growth so we experimented with creating an interactive sharing experience for the newsletter. When you click the share button in the newsletter, it will take you to a page where you can customize a message and graphic that can be shared on LinkedIn or Twitter (X). Because neither platform supports attaching images in their intent URLs, I built a service that would take in a query param and generate an image on the fly based on what the user had selected in the composer.
